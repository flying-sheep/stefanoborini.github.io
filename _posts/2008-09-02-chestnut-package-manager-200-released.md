Chestnut Package Manager 2.0.0 released
=======================================

I just released a program I developed: [Chestnut Package
Manager](http://chestnut.sourceforge.net/), a utility to handle
executables and resource files in a transparent, platform independent
and relocatable way. Its concept is similar to Apple bundles and Java
archives. It is implemented in Python.

I also provide a nice tutorial about how to use it and how to deploy
your packages. It has been very useful to me, and I guess it will be for
other people out there.
